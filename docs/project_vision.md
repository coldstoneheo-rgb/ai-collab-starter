# AI-Collab-Starter: Project Vision

## Mission

Create a safe, controlled, and transparent AI multi-agent collaboration system that enables solo developers to achieve enterprise-grade software quality through intelligent orchestration of specialized AI agents.

## Core Vision

**"AI를 조직처럼 운영하는 멀티-에이전트 개발 오케스트레이터"**

Transform GitHub into a platform where:
- Claude acts as Project Manager
- Gemini leads Frontend & UX
- Perplexity ensures Compliance
- GPT handles Backend & Infrastructure

All working together under human oversight.

## Goals

### Short-term (Phase 1 - 6 weeks)
- [ ] Real AI code reviews on every PR
- [ ] Audit logging of all AI actions
- [ ] Cost tracking and enforcement
- [ ] Emergency kill-switch operational
- [ ] 95% PR success rate

### Mid-term (Phase 2-3 - 6 months)
- [ ] Vector RAG for 10x context accuracy
- [ ] Metrics-driven continuous improvement
- [ ] Selective automation for low-risk tasks
- [ ] Multi-project template proven

### Long-term (Phase 4 - 1 year+)
- [ ] Full AI Dev Studio capabilities
- [ ] Enterprise adoption
- [ ] Open-source community
- [ ] Industry standard for AI collaboration

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative
- PR processing time < 5 minutes
- AI suggestion acceptance rate > 70%
- Cost per PR < $1
- Zero security incidents
- Test coverage > 80%

### Qualitative
- Developers trust AI recommendations
- Code quality measurably improved
- Development velocity increased
- Team collaboration enhanced

## Principles (Unchangeable)

1. **사람이 최종 책임을 진다** - Humans maintain final responsibility
2. **AI는 제안하고, 사람이 결정한다** - AI suggests, humans decide
3. **안전이 속도보다 우선한다** - Safety before speed
4. **투명성과 감사 가능성** - Full transparency and auditability
5. **단계적 확장** - Phased expansion with validation

## Non-Goals (What We Won't Do)

- ❌ Fully autonomous coding without human oversight
- ❌ Replace human developers
- ❌ AI-to-AI code generation loops (Phase 1-2)
- ❌ Automatic deployment without approval
- ❌ Compromise on safety for convenience

## Roadmap Overview

```
Phase 0 (Current) → Phase 1 (MVP) → Phase 2 (Production) → Phase 3 (Selective Auto) → Phase 4 (Studio)

  Scaffold       Real Reviews        Intelligent RAG      Low-risk Auto-merge      Full Orchestration
  Docs Only      API Integration     Metrics & Alerts     Canary Rollout          (Very Cautious)
```

## Target Audience

### Primary
- Solo developers working on complex projects
- Small teams (2-5 people) needing code review
- Open-source maintainers
- Indie hackers building SaaS

### Secondary
- Medium-sized teams wanting AI augmentation
- Companies exploring AI-assisted development
- Engineering teams with limited senior developers

## Competitive Advantage

**What makes us different:**
1. **Multi-agent collaboration** (not single AI)
2. **Safety-first design** (not move-fast-break-things)
3. **Transparent governance** (not black box)
4. **Phased expansion** (not all-or-nothing)
5. **Open architecture** (not vendor lock-in)

## Values

- **Trust through transparency**
- **Quality over quantity**
- **Sustainable automation**
- **Community-driven**
- **Ethical AI use**
